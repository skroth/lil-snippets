# Zombies

I used a Monte Carlo simulation to repeatedly find the next best choice for the player to take. 
My solution ended up scoring as the [#1 Python solution in the US and 18th in the world](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-vs-zombies/leaderboard), which I thought was pretty cool. The code was written pretty hastily in my free time so it is not the cleanest and I am not very proud of it. Maybe at some point I will clean it up.
